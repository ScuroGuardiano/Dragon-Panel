# Holy Grail

The Holy Grail of server administration.

## The Chaos
At the very beginning there was chaos. Services, VM-s, Containers and anything in between created and managed manually. Every domain entry added on provider's site, every reverse proxy record added by hand. Guardiano got very frustrated by looking at this mess. So in his all mightiness he started creating The Holy Administration Panel that will solve all problem of this chaotic Dark Age. He called it The Holy Grail. Of course he knew he can't to this alone. So he asked for help mighty avatars of holy web development. Chaos is left without a chance against this Divine Crusade. The mighty avatars are:

## Nest.js
Mighty cat that will walk beside me to fight with chaotic forces of evil javascript. With his strong and solid body I shall not be defeated by the Lord of Spaghetti!

## Angular
Indestructible by the evil forces of Javascript shield. Made with adamantium by the mystic, legendary smiths from the Valley of Gugol

## ngx-ui
Cool UI Library ^^ Thanks it I shall not fall to the ancient demon of poor UI desing, which has no name, such mess it is.

## Yarn
Is endless bag, yet it makes it easy to manage my inventory. I shall use it to manage all my holy weapons against evil forces of Chaos!
